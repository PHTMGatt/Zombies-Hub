Originally hidden as a bonus mode in World at War, Nacht der Untoten spawned the entire Treyarch Zombies saga—introducing the Ray Gun, mystery box, and boarded-window defense mechanics. Its simple three-room layout was remastered for Black Ops 1 and again in the Zombies Chronicles pack for Black Ops III, and even fragments of its map reappear in later levels like Green Run, Revelations, and Cold War’s Die Maschine. Survive as long as you can—this is the blueprint for everything that followed.",
