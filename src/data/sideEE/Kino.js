    description: `
There are four possible teleport rooms after entering Pack-a-Punch—but only three reels spawn each match. Look in:

• Samantha’s Room (intact): on the table, bed, or leaning against the rocking chair  
• Samantha’s Room (destroyed): on the bed, overturned table, or near the window  
• Dentist’s Office: on the cart next to the chair or on the counters  
• Conference Room: on the TV, under the projector, or on the table  

Collect all three, then return to the Pack-a-Punch projector and hit “Use” to play the film. After the next teleport, a rocket appears in the Conference Room—shoot it to launch.`,

    description: `
There are two hidden radios. To activate each, shoot or throw an explosive at it:

1. **Chandelier**: tucked inside the theater’s chandelier  
2. **Tower**: at the top of the tower seen from the alley by Double Tap Root Beer (interact to activate)`,
